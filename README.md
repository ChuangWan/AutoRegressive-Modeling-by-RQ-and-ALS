  Conditional autoregressive model is structure scheme in modeling financial time series. Based on this structure setting has derived three classes of models: GARCH, CAViaR and CARE. The biggest difference among them are their optimization methods. In this repository, we mainly discuss the two of mentioned above models: CAViaR and CARE. Conditional AutoRegressive Value at Risk by Regression (CAViaR) is a VaR model for modeling the risk proprsed by Engle and Mangnell(2004)。The core of CAViaR is interpreting the VaR as a particular quantile of furture porfolio values conditional on current information. Because the distribution of portfolio returns typically changes over time, the challenge is to find a suitable model for time-varying conditional quantiles. CAViaR model can measure for VaR directly, the unknown parameters are estimated using Koenker and Bassett’s(1978) regression quantile framework.
